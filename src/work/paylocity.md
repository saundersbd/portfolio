# Paylocity

I've been working at Paylocity since June 2016. I've worked on a variety of products in that time, from legacy payroll products to brand new social network products.

_Unfortunately I am NDA'd out the wazoo, which prevents me from going into great detail about the work I do at Paylocity. Please [get in touch](mailto:saundersbd@gmail.com) if you'd like to hear more about the problems I'm solving_.

## Community

Right now I'm the lead designer on the Community product, which is an internal communication and collaboration platform for employees at companies that use Paylocity. Workplace by Facebook is a similar product. The main advantage Community has over the other products in this space is that employees are defaulted into the ecosystem just by being Paylocity customers. Administrators don't need to add new employees to Community when they join the company. It all happens automatically.

### Features I've worked on include:

- Activity feed
- Groups
- Knowledge groups (a special group type designed around a ticketing model)
- Dynamic membership in groups (member lists automatically maintained based on employee criteria)
- Company-wide announcements

### The most challenging problems we face are:

- Gaining widespread adoption
- We are a smallish team with a big roadmap. It's hard to compete with the heavy-hitters in the tech industry.

## üçä Citrus Design System

I spend a lot of time writing and thinking about Citrus, our internal design system. I worked with another designer to pioneer a task force responsible for defining the Citrus principles. I also contribute back to the design system on a weekly basis.

## Single Employee Record
Sometimes employees for large companies work at multiple locations at the same time. When this is the situation, they have separate login credentials for each location, and the company administrators have to maintain separate records for the employee as well. It's a bad experience for both employees and admins. The single employee record project represents a technical and experiential feat that enables admins to access all the important information about an employee in a single place, from anywhere within the application. Employees can also use a single login to view all of their information in one place.

### Challenges

- To make this feature work we had to devise a new pattern that would feel at home in any context across the vast Paylocity suite.
- We had to fit an immense amount of information into a modular view without it feeling too heavy.

## Prorated/Retro Pay Calculator

This is a tool that helps payroll administrators calculate partial paycheck amounts if an employee did not work for a full pay period. It can also help calculate an employee's back-pay.

### Challenges

- This was the most complicated product I ever worked on because of the sheer number of scenarios that had to be accounted for: over 30 separate scenarios with varying degrees of complexity.
- Payroll is a complex subject that I had to work hard to understand.

## Cross-company Data Management

This feature makes it easy for company administrators to manage changes to company configurations across many locations. Previously, if I wanted to change a company-wide deduction code, I would have to make that same change for each company location. Now I change it in one place and the change propagates to the remaining locations automatically. This feature saves a lot of time.

## Company Set Batch Payroll

This feature makes it easy for administrators who manage payroll across multiple company to see the status of this check date's payroll across all their supervised companies, in a single place. As a payroll admin I can now see when each location hasn't started, has started, or has submitted payroll for a given check date. Previously I could not see all this information in one place.

## Retention Risk Dashboard

My first project at Paylocity was the retention risk dashboard, which allows company administrators to identify which employees might be at the greatest risk of leaving the company. It aggregates information such as commute length, performance evaluations, and tenure to assign employees a rip factor. Administrators can then be more proactive in engaging with those employees.
