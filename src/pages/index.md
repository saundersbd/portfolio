# I'm Brian Saunders, a Product Designer who lives in Chicago.

I do all the things that the other Product Designers do, and I do some of them quite well! Right now I'm improving employee engagement and working on design systems at Paylocity. I’m happiest when I know that my work is making someone’s life easier.

In my spare time I like to read and play the piano. Send me a message at [saundersbd@gmail.com](saundersbd@gmail.com).

## Experience

### Paylocity

#### Product Designer (since June 2016)

I joined the design team at Paylocity when it was relatively young and have seen it grow to over 30 people. In my time there I've worked on Analytics, Payroll, HR, and social networking products. Currently I am the lead designer on a product that has over 16 developers and QA engineers.

### Vokal Interactive

#### User Experience Designer (2014–2016)

Vokal is an agency that specializes in mobile apps, but most of the projects I worked on spanned multiple platforms. Often I was the primary designer on projects that had web, iOS, and Android components. I had to be an expert in multi-platform design patterns and create re-usable design systems to be successful.

### Maddock Douglas, Inc.

#### User Experience Designer (2010–2014)

Maddock Douglas is an "innovation agency." They use research and experience to help their clients figure out what the next big thing in their industry is. I worked there for 3.5 years and got to do a little bit of everything. Most of my time was spent building interactive prototypes as proofs-of-concept for our customers. The biggest project I worked on was the redesign of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan website.
